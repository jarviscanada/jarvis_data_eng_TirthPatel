    description: "Created a personalized job search tool developed to streamline the process of finding relevant job postings for job seekers. This Spring Boot application leverages the power of Large Language Models (OpenAI), JSoup web scraping, and MySQL to automate the job search process by fetching, ranking, and storing job listings that match the user's profile and preferences. This automation reduced the time job seekers manually spend filtering relevant job postings, allowing them to get more throughput while applying."
