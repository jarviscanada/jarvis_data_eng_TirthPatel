# Introduction
This project serves to demonstrate the implementation of a simple back end insurance application. Insurance companies use such applications to manage their data, which can be used to extract valuable insights for their business needs. Users can use this Spring Boot application through various API endpoints, depending on the use case. All data is saved on a MongoDB NoSQL instance. The technologies used to implement this application include Spring Boot, MongoDB, and Postman (testing API endpoints). 


# Setup
## Prerequisites
- MongoDB server should be installed
- MongoDB compass should be installed (GUI for MongoDB Server)
- Postman should be installed for testing APIs
## Quick Start
1. Run MongoDB Server (should be serving on localhost:27017)
2. Connect to MongoDB Server using MongoDB Compass and create a new database named `insurance`
3. Build and run the SpringBoot application
4. Explore the different enpoints for this application (See below)
